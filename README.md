## Troubleshooting
### Delivery Delays :clock230: :car:
Problem: Deliveries can be delayed due to traffic, high demand at restaurants, or drivers having trouble finding the customer’s location.
##### ***Solution:***
- Use real-time GPS tracking to provide more accurate delivery time estimates.
- Implement a feature that allows customers to share more detailed location information or even send directions to the driver.
- Improve communication between restaurants, drivers, and customers to provide updates on delivery status.
### Order Errors :iphone:
Problem: Orders may arrive with missing items, incorrect meals, or items that don’t match the customer’s original request.
##### ***Solution:***
- Introduce a double-check system at the restaurant before the order is handed to the delivery driver.
- Provide an easy way for users to report errors within the app, with automated compensation options such as refunds or credits.
- Allow customers to review their order details after placement and before delivery to confirm accuracy.
### Difficulty Tracking Orders :pushpin: :earth_asia:
Problem: Users might struggle with delayed or inaccurate tracking information, leading to confusion about when their food will arrive.
##### ***Solution:***
- Enhance the accuracy of the real-time tracking system for both the restaurant's preparation time and the driver’s location.
- Send automated updates (push notifications or SMS) when key milestones are reached (e.g., order accepted, out for delivery, arriving soon).
- Allow users to directly contact the delivery driver through the app in case of issues.
### Payment Issues :credit_card:
Problem: Technical issues during the payment process, such as rejected credit cards or failed transactions, can frustrate users.
##### ***Solution:***

- Implement a "retry payment" feature to allow users to easily retry failed transactions.
- Regularly update and test the payment gateway to prevent errors, and provide clear error messages when payments fail.
### High Delivery Fees :arrow_upper_right:

- Offer dynamic pricing for delivery fees based on distance and order size, or provide free delivery for orders over a certain amount.
